        Starlit 'Starry' Night is a unicorn turned alicorn who was turned into the goddess of the night, sorcery and intelligence by Queen Irene.</p>

        <h1 style=text-align:center>History:</h1>
            
        <p style=text-align:center>Starlit was born to two unicorn nobles, Duchess Pampered Ruby and Duke Cosseted Nobleman, giving her the title of lady while she was a foal and the title of Duchess once she turned eighteen.
            
        Starry loathed her constricting life, always having to keep her reputation in mind, not being allowed to befriend anypony with lesser social status, not that she didn't try.
            
        She befriended a unicorn commoner named Galaxia at the age of twelve, and the two remained friends till Starry turned fourteen, much to her parents' disapproval, until one of her mother's insults towards Galaxia became too much for Galaxia to bear and the filly ended her friendship with Starry.
            
        The very same day, at a dinner hosted by her parents, Starlit heard a filly singing, and awed by the beauty of her voice, followed the sound and found that the filly singing was Radiant Beam, daughter of Duchess Bejewelled Coronet and Duke Dinero Gelt.
            
        It turns out that her parents were against Radiant singing, so the two fillies bonded over their frustration regarding their parents and became friends.</p>
            
        <h1 style=text-align:center>Agrument with Radiant:</h1>
        <p style=text-align:center>One day, Starlit and Radiant were playing at Radiant's house. It was slightly raining and Starry wanted to play in the rain, however Radiant didn't want to as she was afraid that the rain would ruin her mane and she didn't want to  get muddy. Instead, she decided to make a dress and use Starry as a model, which Starry found very boring, and she said so.
            
        Losing her cool, Radiant lashed out and said some very hurtful things to her friend, which in turn upset and enraged her, and Starry left.
            
        Starry, who eventually found herself in a forest, stumbled on a criminalistic scene.
            
        Meanwhile, Radiant, who had been feeling quite guilty, eventually left in search for her friend and a mysterious ball of light, that they later found out was Queen Irene, guided her to her friend.
            
        Together, the two saved the victim, a mare called Crystal Rose and made amends.</p>
        
        
    <h1  style=text-align:center>Appearance:</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center">Starry has a brilliant white coat and midnight blue eyes that she inherited from her mother. Her mane and tail were jet black, streaked with navy and flowed down with naturally but seemed to be held up from their original position with a spell or maybe a couple dozen pins.</p>
